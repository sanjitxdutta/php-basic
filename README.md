## 🧪 Mini Project: Travel Form

The `index.php` file contains a travel form where users can:
- Submit their details like name, age, gender, and additional info
- Data is stored locally (usually in a `.txt` file or for future DB use)

> It's a practical example of how PHP handles form submissions using the `POST` method.
